/**
 * For authorizing a user we are using jsonwebtoken
 * Main idea: 
 * 1) While sign up or login we are creating a token for that user at that event and send along the response.
 * 2) In future, when that user try to access the authorized routes (like /task here) then front client side the authorized token should 
 * be sent through in the header.
 * 3) In the middleware we check if the token provided is correct or not. If the token provided is correct then we let the user to access the 
 * authorized routes otherwise redirect the user to login page.
 * This is basically called session-based authentication
 *
